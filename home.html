        I went to the shops in the morning. I needed 
        <a href="https://www.ivanl.in/riichi-trainer/" target="_blank" style="all: unset; cursor: pointer;">
          milk, bread, and some tea
        </a>.
        The shop was quiet, just the grocer and an old woman buying eggs. I waited my turn, paid for the things, and walked back. When I got home, I put the kettle on and arranged the groceries in their proper places. Then I sat down and looked out the window for a while. There wasn’t much happening. A dog walked by, sniffing at the fence. After that, I started sorting my stamp collection. It took up most of the afternoon.
